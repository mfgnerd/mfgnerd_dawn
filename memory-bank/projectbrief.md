# Project Brief: MFGnerd Shopify Store

## 1. Overview

This project involves setting up and customizing a Shopify store for the MFGnerd brand. The primary goal is to create an e-commerce presence on a dedicated subdomain (`store.mfgnerd.ca`) that visually aligns with the existing MFGnerd Astro blog (`mfgnerd.ca`), while keeping the blog and store technically separate.

## 2. Core Requirements

*   Establish a Shopify store using the Dawn theme as a base.
*   Customize the Dawn theme to replicate the branding (colors, typography, layout feel) of the `mfgnerd.ca` Astro site.
*   Implement both light and dark mode color palettes, matching the Astro site, including a functional theme toggle button.
*   Initially list products from both the Hydrosnap and RMEV lines.
*   Ensure the store supports Shopify's native 3D model display capabilities.
*   Maintain the separation between the Astro blog (hosted independently) and the Shopify store.

## 3. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Theme customization (CSS, JS, potentially Liquid/JSON) of the Dawn theme.
    *   Implementation of specific branding elements identified from `mfgnerd.ca`.
    *   Setup of basic store structure (linking back to the main blog).
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Product data entry and configuration (beyond what's needed for theme testing).
    *   Shopify account setup, payment gateway configuration, shipping setup.
    *   Advanced marketing or SEO strategy implementation.
    *   Development of a headless Shopify solution using the Storefront API.
    *   Migration of blog content into Shopify.
    *   Creation of the separate `hydrosnap.ca` store (Phase 2).

## 4. Success Criteria

*   The `store.mfgnerd.ca` site visually resembles `mfgnerd.ca` in terms of color scheme, typography (IBM Plex Mono), and general layout feel.
*   A functional light/dark mode toggle exists and applies the correct color palettes.
*   The store functions correctly on the Shopify platform using the customized Dawn theme.
*   The solution maintains the technical separation between the blog and the store.
