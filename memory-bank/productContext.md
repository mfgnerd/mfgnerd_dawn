# Product Context: MFGnerd Shopify Store

## 1. Problem Space

*   The MFGnerd brand currently sells products (Hydrosnap, RMEV lines) through Etsy.
*   There's a desire to gain more control over the e-commerce experience compared to Etsy.
*   The existing MFGnerd blog (`mfgnerd.ca`) is a separate, high-performing Astro site that needs to remain independent.
*   A consolidated, self-hosted platform is needed to initially sell both product lines under the MFGnerd brand.

## 2. Goals

*   Create a dedicated Shopify store (`store.mfgnerd.ca`) to serve as the primary e-commerce channel for MFGnerd products.
*   Provide a user experience that is visually consistent with the existing `mfgnerd.ca` blog, reinforcing the brand identity.
*   Leverage Shopify's robust e-commerce backend for product management, cart, checkout, and potentially 3D model display.
*   Establish a foundation that allows for potential future expansion, such as spinning off product lines (e.g., Hydrosnap) into their own dedicated stores.
*   Maintain the performance and independence of the existing Astro blog.

## 3. User Experience

*   **Visual Consistency:** The store should feel like a natural extension of the blog. Key visual elements like color palettes (light/dark modes), typography (IBM Plex Mono), and overall minimalist/technical aesthetic should be mirrored.
*   **Seamless Navigation:** Clear links between the blog and the store (e.g., "Shop" link on blog header, "Blog" link on store header) should provide easy navigation between the two sites.
*   **Standard E-commerce Functionality:** Users expect standard features like product browsing (collections, product pages), variant selection, cart management, and a secure checkout process (provided by Shopify).
*   **Theme Toggle:** Users should be able to switch between light and dark modes, matching the functionality on the blog.
